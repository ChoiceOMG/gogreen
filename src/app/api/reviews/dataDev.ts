    text: 'It was my first time getting my hair cut and styled in a salon in many years! Bella made my first visit back so enjoyable. She took the time to listen to what I wanted and confirmed by repeating what I said to her. She also had some suggestions which I agreed to. She made me feel incredibly comfortable and was knowledgeable and friendly. I would definitely go back and have Bella do my hair again. 5/5 Stars!',
